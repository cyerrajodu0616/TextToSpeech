A journalist asks Cristiano Ronaldo: Why does your mother still live with you?. "My mother raised me and she dedicated her life for me. She would go to sleep hungry, just to let me eat. We had no money at all. She worked 7 days a week & nights as a maid to buy my first shoes so I could be a player. All my success is dedicated to her and because of her and as long as she has a life, she will always be by my side, she has everything I can give. She is my refuge and my greatest gift."

So I sit down on the stairs and help her put pants on. And then she proceeds to ask me to pick her up and hug her.....and that would be the best part of my shift today." --model_name "tts_models/en/multi-dataset/tortoise-v2" --vocoder_name "vocoder_models/de/thorsten/hifigan_v1" --out_path C:\Work\GitHubRepo\TextToSpeech\Kids-911.wav
